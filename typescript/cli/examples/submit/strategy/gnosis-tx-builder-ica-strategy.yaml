# The transactions to be sent on polygonamoy will be sent from
# basesepolia and submitted using a SAFE multisig wallet which
# is the owner of the ICA account on the remote chain. The transaction
# will then be relayed by a relayer on the destination chain and executed by the
# Interchain Account derived from the combination of the owner address, the origin chain
# and the ica router on the origin chain. See https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/applications/interchain-account
