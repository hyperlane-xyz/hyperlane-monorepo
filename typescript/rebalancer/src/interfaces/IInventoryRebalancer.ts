/**
 * Interface for executing inventory-based rebalances.
 *
 * The InventoryRebalancer handles rebalancing for chains that don't support
 * MovableCollateralRouter (e.g., Solana). It processes ONE intent at a time:
 *
 * 1. If an in_progress intent exists, continue it (ignore new routes)
 * 2. If no intent exists, take the FIRST route only, create an intent, and execute
 *
 * IMPORTANT: transferRemote ADDS collateral to the chain it's called FROM.
 * So for a strategy route "origin (surplus) → destination (deficit)":
 *
 * 1. Check if inventory is available on the DESTINATION (deficit) chain
 * 2. If not, create an inventory_movement action to bridge inventory TO destination
 * 3. Once inventory is on destination, create an inventory_deposit action
 *    which calls transferRemote FROM destination TO origin (swapped direction!)
 *
 * This results in:
 * - Collateral ADDED to destination (deficit filled!)
 * - Collateral RELEASED from origin (surplus reduced)
