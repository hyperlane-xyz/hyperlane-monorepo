//! The message explorer scraper is responsible for building and maintaining a
//! relational database of the Hyperlane state across blockchains to empower us and
//! our users to trace and debug messages and other system state.
//!
//! Information scrapped is predominately recoverable simply be re-scraping the
//! blockchains, however, they may be some additional "enrichment" which is only
//! practically discoverable at the time it was recorded. This additional
//! information is not critical to the functioning of the system.
//!
//! One scraper instance is run per chain and together they will be able to
//! piece together the full hyperlane system state in the relational database.
