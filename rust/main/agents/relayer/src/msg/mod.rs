#![allow(clippy::doc_lazy_continuation)] // TODO: `rustc` 1.80.1 clippy issue

//! Processor scans DB for new messages and wraps relevant messages as a
//! `PendingOperation` and then sends it over a channel to a submitter for
//! delivery.
//!
//! A submitter uses some strategy to try to execute the pending operations.
//! Pending operations have three steps for execution, `prepare`, `submit`, and
//! `confirm` The `prepare` step is used to do any read-only blockchain
//! calls that are needed to determine if the operation is ready to be submitted
//! and to get the data required to actually submit it. The `submit` step is
//! used to actually submit the transaction to the blockchain. The `confirm`
//! step is used to validate the transaction survived the reorg window.
//!
//! Creating this separation between `prepare` and `submit` enables preparing
//! one operation while waiting for another to be submitted; and then `confirm`
//! allows us to re-run the operation if it succeeded but did not actually end
//! up getting included.
//!
//! Right now there is one strategy: serial.
//!
//! In the future it could make sense for there to be more, some ideas are:
//!   - BatchingMessagesSubmitter
//!   - ShardedWalletSubmitter (to get parallelism / nonce)
//!   - SpeculativeSerializedSubmitter (batches with higher optimistic nonces,
//!     recovery behavior)
//!   - FallbackProviderSubmitter (Serialized, but if some RPC provider sucks,
//!   switch everyone to new one)
