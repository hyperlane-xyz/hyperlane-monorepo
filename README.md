## Versioning

Note this is the branch for Hyperlane v3.

V2 is deprecated in favor of V3. The code for V2 can be found in the [v2](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/v2) branch. For V1 code, refer to the [v1](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/v1) branch.

## Overview

Hyperlane is an interchain messaging protocol that allows applications to communicate between blockchains.

Developers can use Hyperlane to share state between blockchains, allowing them to build interchain applications that live natively across multiple chains.

To read more about interchain applications, how the protocol works, and how to integrate with Hyperlane, please see the [documentation](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz).

## Working on Hyperlane

### Prerequisites

#### Install `jq`

You need `jq` installed on your machine. You can download it from [official page](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) or use a package manager of your choice.

#### Install `gitleaks`

You need `gitleaks` installed on your machine. You can download it from [official page](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) or use a package manager of your choice.

#### Foundry

First ensure you have Foundry installed on your machine.

Run the following to install `foundryup`:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Then run `foundryup` to install `forge`, `cast`, `anvil` and `chisel`.

```bash
foundryup
```

Check out the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for more information.

#### Node

This repository targets v20 of node. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your node version.

To install nvm

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```

To install version 20

```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
```

You should change versions automatically with the `.nvmrc` file.

### Workspaces

This monorepo uses [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces). Installing dependencies, building, testing, and running prettier for all packages can be done from the root directory of the repository.

- Installing dependencies

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

- Building

  ```bash
  yarn build
  ```

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can launch the [multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) with `code mono.code-workspace`, install the recommended workspace extensions, and use the editor settings.

### Logging

The typescript tooling uses [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) based logging, which outputs structured JSON logs by default.
The verbosity level and style can be configured with environment variables:

```sh
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|OFF
LOG_FORMAT=PRETTY|JSON
```

### Rust

See [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md)

### Release Agents

- Tag the commit with the current date in the format `agents-yyyy-mm-dd`; e.g. `agents-2023-03-28`.
- [Create a Github Release](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/releases/new) with a changelog against the previous version titled `Agents MMMM DD, YYYY`, e.g. `Agents March 28, 2023`.
- Include the agent docker image tag in the description of the release
- Create a summary of change highlights
- Create a "breaking changes" section with any changes required
- Deploy agents with the new image tag (if it makes sense to)

### Releasing packages to NPM

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to release to NPM. You can use the `release` script in `package.json` to publish.

For an alpha or beta version, follow the directions [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md).
