The CLI warp route reference methods were consolidated into a single --warp-route-id flag. The --config/-wd (deploy config path) and --warp/-wc (warp config path) flags were removed in favor of registry-based warp route IDs. Commands now use warpRouteId to reference warp routes instead of file paths.

Added SDK utilities for filtering warp routes by chains: `getChainsFromWarpCoreConfig`, `warpCoreConfigMatchesChains`, and `filterWarpCoreConfigMapByChains`. Symbol-only warp route references (e.g., `-w ETH`) can now be filtered by chains to auto-resolve when origin/destination uniquely identify a route.
