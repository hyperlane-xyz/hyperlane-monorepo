Added mailbox and validator announce artifact interfaces in provider-sdk. The new interfaces establish the contract for mailbox and validator announce artifacts, including MailboxConfig with ISM and Hook artifact references, ValidatorAnnounceConfig with mailbox address reference, and raw artifact variants for protocol implementation use.
