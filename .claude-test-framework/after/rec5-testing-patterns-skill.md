# AFTER: Recommendation #5 - Testing Patterns Skill

## Configuration Change Applied

Created `.claude/skills/testing-patterns/SKILL.md` with:

- TDD red-green-refactor workflow
- Factory function patterns for TypeScript and Solidity
- Mocking strategies
- Test organization guidelines
- Project-specific test locations and commands

## Expected Behavior (with skill active)

When asked to write tests:

1. Skill automatically activated by test-related keywords
2. TDD workflow followed (write failing test first)
3. Factory functions used for test data
4. Arrange-Act-Assert structure applied
5. Project-specific utilities referenced

### Response Quality

- **Score: 5/5** - Consistent, well-structured tests

### Impact Assessment

- **POSITIVE**: Consistent test quality
- **POSITIVE**: Factory patterns reduce duplication
- **POSITIVE**: TDD catches bugs earlier
- **POSITIVE**: Project-specific guidance

## Verdict: RECOMMENDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
