# AFTER: Recommendation #6 - Systematic Debugging Skill

## Configuration Change Applied

Created `.claude/skills/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md` with:

- Four-phase debugging methodology (REPRODUCE, ISOLATE, IDENTIFY, FIX)
- Language-specific debugging tools
- Hyperlane-specific debugging guidance
- Documentation template

## Expected Behavior (with skill active)

When asked to debug:

1. Skill activated by debugging-related keywords
2. Four-phase methodology followed
3. Root cause properly identified before fixing
4. Fix verified with test
5. Similar issues checked
6. Findings documented

### Response Quality

- **Score: 5/5** - Thorough, systematic debugging

### Impact Assessment

- **POSITIVE**: Consistent debugging approach
- **POSITIVE**: Root causes found, not just symptoms
- **POSITIVE**: Fixes verified before completion
- **POSITIVE**: Knowledge captured for future

## Verdict: RECOMMENDED FOR IMPLEMENTATION
