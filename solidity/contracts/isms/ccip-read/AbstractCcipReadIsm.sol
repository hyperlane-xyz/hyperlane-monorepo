 * @title AbstractCcipReadIsm
 * @notice An ISM that allows arbitrary payloads to be submitted and verified on chain
 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668
 * @dev The AbstractCcipReadIsm provided by Hyperlane is left intentionally minimalist as
 * the range of applications that could be supported by a CcipReadIsm are so broad. However
 * there are few things to note when building a custom CcipReadIsm.
 *
 * 1. `getOffchainVerifyInfo` should revert with a `OffchainLookup` error, which encodes
 *    the data necessary to query for offchain information
 * 2. For full CCIP Read specification compatibility, CcipReadIsm's should expose a function
 *    that in turn calls `process` on the configured Mailbox with the provided metadata and
 *    message. This functions selector should be provided as the `callbackFunction` payload
 *    for the OffchainLookup error
